On this site, speakers and booth representatives could upload information needed by the conference organizers. <br /> I designed and build the platform, which contained both a client view and admin view. It was build using React, Semantic UI, Node.js, MongoDB & Amazon AWS.</p><p>For the conference, nextM were to build a photobooth. I made the site where conference goers were able to see and download their picture taken with the photobooth. <br/> The pictures were fetched from an S3 bucket and displayed using lazy loading.  During the conference I was responsible for getting the photobooth up and running in the morning.</p><p>After the conference, we had to make a post-conference site, where users could see videos of keynote speeches, photos and media coverage. <br/> I made the slider carousel for the speaker videos. When pressing the chosen speaker, I made an animation that opened a box with the video in it. It was done with CSS animations. The site can be visited <a href="http://nextm.io/" style="color:#6787a6">here.</a></p>'
